# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by problem set. 

## About

This project was generated using the [leetcode_tool](https://github.com/Hamza-ouabiba/leetcode_tool) repository by [Hamza Ouabiba](https://github.com/Hamza-ouabiba), which streamlines the process of organizing and managing LeetCode solutions.

## Structure

The solutions are organized by problem categories and include:

- **Problem Title**: Each folder is named after the problem title.
- **Solution**: Inside each folder, you will find a file named `solution` with the current implementation in the respective language (e.g., `solution.py` or `solution.cpp`).
